    Have you at anytime witnessed a relative of yours or a close friend<br> searching frantically for a blood donor, when blood banks say<br> out of stock, the donors in mind are out of reach and the time<br> keeps ticking? Have you witnessed loss of life for the only reason<br> that a donor was not available at the most needed hour? Is it<br> something that we as a society can do nothing to prevent? This<br> thought laid our foundation.<br>

       "Friends2support" is an organization that brings voluntary blood donors and<br> those in need of blood on to a common platform.  Through this website, we<br> seek donors who are willing to donate blood, as well as provide the timeliest<br> support to those in frantic need of it. <br>

       Started in the year 2005, on 14th Nov, in a small room with just 100 voluntary<br> donors but with the zeal to serve our society, to inspire and spread the <br>word, we dream to fulfill 100% blood need in India.<br><br>

       Our mission is to fulfill every blood request in the country with a promising<br> web portal and motivated individuals who are willing to donate blood.<br><br>

       <mark>Our vision is to be "The hope of every Indian in search of a voluntary blood donor"</mark><br>

       <mark>Our motto - "Donate blood to save the most precious human life"</mark><br>
